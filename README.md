This is a project for the beginners that want a 'visual cue' as to how different properties within the Flexbox work.

I have used the basic state management to control the various layouts but I would like to attempt this problem using `useReducer` in the near future.

For styling, I have chosen styled-components which offers a smooth experience in any component-driven framework as it solves the scoping and specificity issues that occur with traiditional CSS right out of the box, among other benifits.

To animate the smooth transition between different layouts, I have used the Framer Motion library which offers a simple approch to achieve this transition.
